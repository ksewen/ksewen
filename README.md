# Hello, I’m **Ksewen** 👋

[Deutsch](./README_DE.md) | [简体中文](./README_ZH.md)

I am a passionate backend developer with an uncommon but very valuable career path:

- **Network Engineering → Software Testing → Backend Engineering → Architecture & Platform Development**

→ This gives me a unique **multi-perspective** and makes me a strong problem solver in enterprise systems.

I currently live in Nuremberg, I am available immediately, and I am looking for a long-term full-time position in
Germany (Backend, Platform, Architecture, DevOps-related development).
